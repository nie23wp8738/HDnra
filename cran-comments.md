## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 2 notes

The notes are as follows:

1. **checking installed package size ... NOTE**

    The installed size is 5.5Mb, with the `data` sub-directory taking up 4.9Mb. This is because the package contains necessary example datasets for the package functionality. Further compression or removal would affect user experience. These datasets are integral to the examples and testing procedures provided by the package.

2. **checking for future file timestamps ... NOTE**

    The system was unable to verify the current time, likely due to the environment in which the checks were run (GitHub Actions, R-hub). This is a known issue in virtualized environments and does not affect the package itself. It is safe to ignore.

## Comments on previous submission

1. Fixed LaTeX errors related to the use of `Ï‡` by replacing it with `$\\chi$` in the Roxygen2 documentation, allowing proper PDF generation.
2. Updated CRAN URL to use the canonical format `https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=HDNRA`.
3. Cleaned up temporary files like `HDNRA-manual.tex`.
4. Renamed the function `BS1996.TS.NART` to `BS1996.TS.NABT` for consistency.
5. Fixed several typos in the documentation and function names.

## Reverse dependencies

`devtools::revdep()` showed that `HDNRA` is not currently a dependency of any other package.
